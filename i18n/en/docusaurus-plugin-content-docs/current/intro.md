# Introduction
Hi! This is the place to explain various things about RT. The RT website is [here](https://rt.rext.dev/), so please check that out as well.

## About RT
RT is a feature-rich Discord bot packed with features that most bots have.  
We've designed it so that RT is all you need to get most things done.  
For example, the following features are commonplace.

- Role panel
- Poll panel
- Ticket panel
- Channel status

Other features not found in many other bots, such as voice rolls, and entertainment music players, TTS, etc. are also included.

## Operator
Rext (formerly RT-Team) is the organization that started RT's operation and development and is still operating and developing it.  
We are also working with an organization commonly known as Sakura Shin-Sen-Gumi for development.

## Price
RTには無料版と製品版があり、無料版には色々な制約があります。  
The commercial version allows for a variety of features and has looser restrictions than the free board.  
More details are compared on the website.
